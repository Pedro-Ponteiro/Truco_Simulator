# Truco_Simulator
#### Project for generating simulations of the game "Truco Paulista", to get data for further analysis.

##### Data file explanation:
1. Columns "highest_card", "middle_card" and "lowest_card" are representations of the values for each card in the player's hand
2. Column "result" holds the outcome for when this hand was played. (1=win, 0.5=draw; 0=loss).
